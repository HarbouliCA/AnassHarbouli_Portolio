# Anass Harbouli - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About
Hi! I'm Anass and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. I have 6 years of experience in the finance industry where I developed and honed my financial skills. In the past two years, I have been working in a technology company as a data analyst. With my solid background in finance and my current experience in technology, I have acquired a strong skillset in data analysis and engineering.

Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my expertise and progress in the field of data analytics and data engineering. I believe that my combination of business and technology knowledge, as well as my practical experience, makes me a valuable asset in any organization. I am eager to apply my skills to new and challenging projects and continue to grow my knowledge and expertise in this field.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  

### A Mobile Game Data Analysis
**Code:** [`final_project.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/final_project.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`my_project_slides.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/my_project_slides.pdf)   
**Description:** The final project for 5 month Data Analysis Course. Setup: you're employed in a mobile games development company. A Product Manager gives you following tasks: to find and visualize retention, to make a decision based on the A/B test data, to suggest a number of metrics to evaluate the results of the last monthly campaign.   
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.     
**Results:** python functions to calculate and plot users retention, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result with a recommendation to push tested in-app changes into production, a set of metrics to evaluate success of promotion campaign.  

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### sklearn ml course
**Description:** Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn by France Université Numérique. [The course official page](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/).  
This 3 month course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons introduce the fundamental methodological and software tools of machine learning, and is as such a stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence, text mining, or data science.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course lectures and tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/sklearn_ml_course)  
**Status:** Completed in May 2022 (please, check the certificates section below).  

### Kaggle 30 Days of ML
**Description:** 30 days of Machine Learning by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml). The course rapidly covers the most essential skills needed to get hands dirty with data and quickly learn how to build machine learning models.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/kaggle_30_Days_of_ML)  
**Status:** Completed in August 2021 (please, check the certificates section below).    

### Data Analyst Specialization
**Description:** This is a 5 month specialization by [karpov.courses](https://karpov.courses/analytics). The specialization includes Python, API, Git, Airflow, SQL, Statistics, A/B testing, Visualization, Product development and Product Analytics modules.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having 37 data analysis mini-projects ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course)  
**Status:** Completed in July 2021 (please, check the certificates section below).  

## Certificates
I think the most effective way to demonstrate abilities is through practical application and sharing the results of your work, although sometimes certificates can be an indirect outcome. Here is a list of the certificates I hold :
- [Teamlead 101](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-12jUVj8OcLlTQ3147syWIP4nf9a2n9P/view?usp=sharing) (Jul 2022) (Stratoplan Management School)
- [sklearn ML course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aUNxDbRCgnKkSzq6LPLRY91Of3L_AyR7/view?usp=sharing) (May 2022) (France Université Numérique)
