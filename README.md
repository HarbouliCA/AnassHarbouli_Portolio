# Anass Harbouli - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About
Hi! I'm Anass and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. I have 6 years of experience in the finance industry where I developed and honed my financial skills. In the past two years, I have been working in a technology company as a data analyst. With my solid background in finance and my current experience in technology, I have acquired a strong skillset in data analysis and engineering.

Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my expertise and progress in the field of data analytics and data engineering. I believe that my combination of business and technology knowledge, as well as my practical experience, makes me a valuable asset in any organization. I am eager to apply my skills to new and challenging projects and continue to grow my knowledge and expertise in this field.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analysis of data extraction and data cleaning 
**Code:** [`Scrapping_and_Cleaning_Data.ipynb`](Scrapping_and_Cleaning_Data.ipynb)    
**Description:** This project is a web scraping script that leverages the power of BeautifulSoup and Pandas to gather data from a website and prepare it for analysis. The script uses BeautifulSoup to extract information from the HTML of a website and store it in a structured format. Pandas is then used to manipulate and clean the data, making it more readable and ready for further analysis. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to gather and prepare data from the web using these powerful tools. The resulting data can be used for a variety of purposes, including generating insights and making data-driven decisions.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.    

### How data analysis saved lives in 1854
**Code:** [`how-data-analysis-saved-lives-in-1854.ipynb`](how-data-analysis-saved-lives-in-1854.ipynb)    
**Description:** This project explores the impact of data analysis in saving lives. This project focuses on the historical event of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the role of John Snow in using data analysis to identify the source of the outbreak. Using the power of pandas and data visualization techniques, I will delve into the story of John Snow and show how data analysis can be used to make a significant impact in public health.  
**Skills:** Data Exploration, Python coding, Data visualization, Data Transformation, Problem-Solving, Communication.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, folium, bokeh      

### Football Analysis Passes and Shoots Location HeatMap
**Code:** [`Football_Analysis_Passes-Location-Heatmap.ipynb`](Football_Analysis_Passes-Location-Heatmap.ipynb)    
**Description:** I have analyzed the performance of two teams, Barcelona and Manchester United, and a player, Xavier Hernández, in a football match. Using a few data analysis techniques, I have created visualizations of the number of passes made by each team, the location of those passes, and heatmaps to represent the concentration of the passes. Additionally, I have also analyzed the number of passes made under pressure and without pressure by Xavier Hernández and the number of shots he took during the game.  
**Skills:** Data Exploration, Python coding, Data visualization, Data Transformation, Problem-Solving, Communication.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Mplsoccer, Statsbombpy.  



## Power Bi

### Financial Statement report
**Report:** [`Financial_Statement_report.pdf`](https://github.com/HarbouliCA/Power_BI/blob/main/Financial_Statement_report/Financial_Statement_report.pdf) <br>
**Project:** [`Financial_Statement_report.pbix`](https://github.com/HarbouliCA/Power_BI/blob/main/Financial_Statement_report/Financial_Statement_report.pbix) <br>
**Description:** This project is a financial statement report that provides a comprehensive analysis of a company's financial performance. The data source for this project was connected using Azure Data Lake Gen 2, and the data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query. It includes various visualizations such as bar charts, Matrix, and Cards to represent the financial data in a clear and easy-to-understand format.<br>
**Skills:** Data Mapping, Data Exploration, Data visualization, Problem-Solving, Communication.  <br>

### Produits Pharma sales Analysis
**Report:** [`Produits Pharma.pdf`](https://github.com/HarbouliCA/Power_BI/blob/main/Produits%20Pharma%20sales%20Analysis/Produits%20Pharma.pdf) <br>
**Project:** [`Produits Pharma.pbix`](https://github.com/HarbouliCA/Power_BI/blob/main/Produits%20Pharma%20sales%20Analysis/Produits%20Pharma.pbix) <br>
**Description:** This project provide a clear insights about the sales performance inside pharma company. The data was cleaned and prepared using excel sheet and power query. It includes various visualizations to represent the turnerover sales over time and the performance of each emplyee by region.<br>
**Skills:** Data Mapping, Data Exploration, Data visualization, Problem-Solving, Communication.  <br>

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase one's abilities is through hands-on implementation and showcasing the outcomes of their work. Although, having certificates can sometimes serve as an additional testament to one's expertise. Here is a list of certificates I possess:
- [Google Data Analytics]() (Jan 2022) (Coursera)
- [DP900 - Azure Data Fundamentals]() (2022) (Online)
- [DP203 - Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure]() (2023) (Online)
